## 🔧 Step 1: Activate Branch Protection Rules

### Current Configuration
The repository has branch protection rules defined in `.github/branch-protection.yml`:

```yaml
main:
  protection:
    required_status_checks:
      strict: true
      contexts:
        - "CI/CD Pipeline / Frontend (Svelte 5)"
        - "CI/CD Pipeline / API (Bun + Hono)"
        - "CI/CD Pipeline / Backend (Go)"
        - "CI/CD Pipeline / Security Scan"
        - "CI/CD Pipeline / Docker Compose"
    enforce_admins: true
    required_pull_request_reviews:
      required_approving_review_count: 2
      dismiss_stale_reviews: true
      require_code_owner_reviews: true
    restrictions:
      users: []

   - Labels: `enhancement`, `web-ui`, `high-priority`, `customer-success`
   - Assignee: @kik200771-oss

2. **Bug Issue**: ClickHouse Query Performance
   - Template: Bug Report
   - Labels: `bug`, `performance`, `clickhouse`, `critical`
   - Assignee: @kik200771-oss

3. **Performance Issue**: API Gateway Bottleneck
   - Template: Performance Issue
   - Labels: `performance`, `api-gateway`, `triage`
   - Assignee: @kik200771-oss

4. **Feature Issue**: Multi-Tenant Security Enhancement
   - Template: Feature Request
   - Labels: `enhancement`, `security`, `rbac`, `medium-priority`
   - Assignee: @kik200771-oss

5. **Infrastructure Issue**: Kubernetes Migration
   - Template: Feature Request
   - Labels: `infrastructure`, `kubernetes`, `production`, `epic`
   - Assignee: @kik200771-oss

### Quick Issue Creation Script
```bash
# After setting up GitHub CLI (gh)
gh issue create --title "[FEATURE] Real-time Attribution Dashboard for Customer Success Metrics" \
  --body-file ./demo-issues/feature-dashboard.md \
  --label "enhancement,web-ui,high-priority,customer-success" \
  --assignee kik200771-oss

gh issue create --title "[BUG] ClickHouse attribution queries timeout after 10 seconds" \
  --body-file ./demo-issues/bug-clickhouse-performance.md \
  --label "bug,performance,clickhouse,critical" \
  --assignee kik200771-oss

# Continue for all demo issues...
```
