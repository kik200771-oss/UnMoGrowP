## üîÑ CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Usage

These scripts are integrated into the main CI/CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

```yaml
# Staging deployment
deploy-staging:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Deploy to staging
      run: ./scripts/deployment/deploy-staging.sh

# Production deployment
deploy-production:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  environment: production
  steps:
    - name: Deploy to production
      run: ./scripts/deployment/deploy-production.sh

# Emergency rollback
rollback:
  if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Execute rollback
      run: ./scripts/deployment/rollback.sh -f
```

### Manual Deployment

For manual deployments outside of CI/CD:

```bash
# 1. Deploy to staging first
./scripts/deployment/deploy-staging.sh

# 2. Verify staging health
./scripts/deployment/health-check.sh -e staging -d

# 3. Deploy to production (requires confirmation)
./scripts/deployment/deploy-production.sh

# 4. Monitor production health
./scripts/deployment/health-check.sh -c -i 30
```

---

## üîç Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Check Automation

**Continuous Monitoring:**
```bash
# Start monitoring in background
nohup ./scripts/deployment/health-check.sh -c -i 30 > health.log 2>&1 &

# Check logs
tail -f health.log
```

**Automated Alerting:**
```bash
# JSON output for monitoring systems
./scripts/deployment/health-check.sh -f json | jq '.overall_status'

# Exit codes for alerting
if ! ./scripts/deployment/health-check.sh; then
    echo "ALERT: Health check failed!"
fi
```

### Prometheus Integration

Health metrics are exposed to Prometheus for dashboard visualization:

- **Basic health score** - `/health` endpoints
- **Response times** - API performance metrics
- **Error rates** - HTTP 5xx responses
- **Resource usage** - CPU, memory, disk

---

## üìä Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Health Check Failures**
```bash
# Check detailed health status
./scripts/deployment/health-check.sh -e production -d

# Check Kubernetes pod status
kubectl get pods -n production

# Check recent events
kubectl get events -n production --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

**2. Deployment Failures**
```bash
# Check deployment status
kubectl get deployments -n production -o wide

# Check pod logs
kubectl logs -n production deployment/api-gateway

# Manual rollback if needed
./scripts/deployment/rollback.sh -e production -s 1
```

**3. Performance Issues**
```bash
# Check response times
./scripts/deployment/health-check.sh | grep "response time"

# Check resource usage
kubectl top pods -n production

# Check Prometheus metrics
curl http://prometheus.attribution.platform/api/v1/query?query=up
```

### Emergency Procedures

**Complete System Failure:**
1. Check overall system health
2. Identify failing components
3. Execute emergency rollback
4. Verify rollback success
5. Investigate root cause

```bash
# 1. Quick health assessment
./scripts/deployment/health-check.sh -f json | jq '.overall_status'

# 2. Emergency rollback
./scripts/deployment/rollback.sh -f

# 3. Verify recovery
./scripts/deployment/health-check.sh -d
```

## üîê Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Scripts require Kubernetes cluster access
- Production deployments require manual approval
- Rollback operations are logged and audited

### Secrets Management
- No secrets stored in scripts
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Kubernetes secrets for application configuration

### Audit Trail
- All operations are logged with timestamps
- Slack notifications for deployment events
- Backup creation before destructive operations

---

## üìà Performance Characteristics

### Deployment Times
- **Staging deployment:** ~2-3 minutes
- **Production deployment:** ~5-8 minutes
- **Emergency rollback:** ~1-2 minutes

### Health Check Performance
- **Basic checks:** ~10-15 seconds
- **Detailed checks:** ~30-45 seconds
- **Continuous monitoring:** Configurable interval

### Resource Requirements
- **CPU:** Minimal (bash scripts)
- **Memory:** <100MB
- **Network:** HTTP requests to endpoints

---

## üöÄ Best Practices

### Deployment Workflow
1. **Always test in staging first**
2. **Verify health before production deployment**
3. **Monitor post-deployment metrics**
4. **Keep rollback plan ready**

### Monitoring Strategy
1. **Continuous health monitoring**
2. **Alerting on critical failures**
3. **Regular performance baseline updates**
4. **Post-incident reviews**

### Emergency Response
1. **Quick assessment with health checks**
2. **Immediate rollback if necessary**
3. **Root cause analysis**
4. **Process improvement**

## üìù Contributing

When modifying deployment scripts:

1. **Test thoroughly in staging**
2. **Update documentation**
3. **Add appropriate error handling**
4. **Include logging for debugging**
5. **Follow existing script patterns**

### Script Development Guidelines
- Use `set -euo pipefail` for safety
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add colored output for readability
- Include usage instructions
- Test all code paths
