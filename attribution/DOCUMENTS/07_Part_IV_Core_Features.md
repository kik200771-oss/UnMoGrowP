## 4.1. Attribution Engine

### Overview

The attribution engine is the heart of the platform, responsible for matching user installs to marketing touchpoints (clicks, impressions, view-throughs) with high accuracy and low latency.

### Attribution Methods

**1. Deterministic Attribution** (Highest Priority)

```yaml
Method: Device ID Matching
Accuracy: 99.9%
Latency: <5ms

Process:
  1. Install event received with IDFA/GAID
  2. Query clicks table for matching device_id
  3. Apply attribution window (7 days click, 1 day view)
  4. Return first touch OR last touch (configurable)

Supported IDs:
  - IDFA (iOS)
  - GAID (Google Advertising ID)
  - IDFV (iOS Vendor ID, fallback)
  - Android ID (fallback)
  - Custom IDs (server-to-server)
```

```rust
// Rust implementation
pub async fn deterministic_match(
    install: &Install,
    pool: &Pool,
) -> Option<Attribution> {
    let query = "
        SELECT * FROM clicks
        WHERE device_id = ?
          AND timestamp > ?
          AND timestamp < ?
        ORDER BY timestamp ASC
        LIMIT 1
    ";

    let click = pool
        .query(query)
        .bind(&install.device_id)
        .bind(install.timestamp - CLICK_WINDOW)
        .bind(install.timestamp)
        .fetch_optional()
        .await?;

    Some(Attribution {
        install_id: install.id,
        click_id: click.id,
        method: Method::Deterministic,
        confidence: 1.0,
        attribution_time: install.timestamp - click.timestamp,
    })
}
```

**2. Referrer Matching** (iOS Universal Links, Android Referrer)

```yaml
Method: Deep Link / Referrer Matching
Accuracy: 95%+
Latency: <10ms

iOS Universal Links:
  - App receives universal link on install
  - Extract campaign parameters
  - Match to click in database
  - Verify timestamp within window

Android Referrer:
  - Google Play Install Referrer API
  - INSTALL_REFERRER broadcast
  - Extract UTM parameters
  - Match to campaign

Parameters:
  - campaign_id
  - publisher_id
  - creative_id
  - click_id (for exact matching)
```

**3. Probabilistic Attribution** (Fingerprinting)

```yaml
Method: Device Fingerprinting + ML
Accuracy: 70-85%
Latency: <50ms

Features (20+):
  - IP address
  - User-Agent string
  - Screen resolution
  - Timezone
  - Language
  - ISP/Carrier
  - Connection type
  - OS version
  - Device model
  - Browser (web)

Algorithm:
  1. Generate fingerprint hash
  2. Find clicks with similar fingerprints
  3. Calculate similarity score (0-1)
  4. ML model predicts match probability
  5. Threshold: >0.7 for attribution

ML Model:
  - Type: Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
  - Features: 20+ device signals
  - Training: 10M+ labeled examples
  - Accuracy: 85% precision, 78% recall
```

**4. Self-Reporting Networks (SRN)**

```yaml
Method: API integration with ad networks
Accuracy: 95%+ (platform-reported)
Latency: <100ms

Supported:
  - Facebook Ads (Marketing API)
  - Google Ads (Conversion Upload)
  - TikTok Ads (Events API)
  - Snapchat Ads (Conversions API)
  - Apple Search Ads

Process:
  1. Install event sent to our platform
  2. We send install back to ad network API
  3. Ad network validates and returns attribution
  4. We record both our attribution + SRN attribution
  5. Reconciliation (weekly reports)

Benefits:
  - Platform-reported numbers (for parity)
  - SKAN support (iOS ATT)
  - No SDK integration needed
```

**5. SKAdNetwork (iOS 14+ Privacy)**

```yaml
Method: Apple's privacy-preserving attribution
Accuracy: Campaign-level only (no user-level)
Latency: 0-24 hour delay

How it works:
  1. User clicks ad
  2. Ad network receives "signed install"
  3. 0-24 hour timer starts (randomized)
  4. Postback sent with:
     - Campaign ID
     - Conversion value (0-63)
     - Did-win flag
  5. We aggregate SKAdNetwork data

Limitations:
  - No user-level data
  - Campaign-level only
  - 24h delay
  - 100 campaign limit per app

Our approach:
  - Combine SKAdNetwork + probabilistic
  - ML model to fill gaps
  - Aggregate reporting for iOS 14+
```

### Multi-Touch Attribution

```yaml
Models Supported:
  - First Touch: Credit to first click
  - Last Touch: Credit to last click (industry standard)
  - Linear: Equal credit to all touches
  - Time Decay: More credit to recent touches
  - U-Shaped: 40% first, 40% last, 20% middle
  - W-Shaped: 30% first, 30% last, 40% middle
  - Data-Driven: ML model learns optimal weights

Implementation:
  - Store all touches (clicks, impressions, views)
  - On install, query all touches within window
  - Apply credit allocation model
  - Write to attribution_touches table
  - Aggregate for reporting
```

```sql
-- Multi-touch attribution query
WITH user_touches AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        touch_type,
        publisher_id,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY timestamp) as touch_number,
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id) as total_touches
    FROM touches
    WHERE user_id = ?
      AND timestamp BETWEEN ? AND ?
)
SELECT
    publisher_id,
    CASE attribution_model
        WHEN 'first_touch' THEN IF(touch_number = 1, 1.0, 0.0)
        WHEN 'last_touch' THEN IF(touch_number = total_touches, 1.0, 0.0)
        WHEN 'linear' THEN 1.0 / total_touches
        WHEN 'time_decay' THEN EXP(-0.7 * (total_touches - touch_number))
    END as credit
FROM user_touches;
```

### Cross-Device Attribution

```yaml
Challenge: User sees ad on mobile, installs on tablet
Solution: Device graph + probabilistic matching

Identity Graph (Neo4j):
  Nodes:
    - Devices (IDFA, GAID, etc.)
    - Users (deterministic ID from login)
    - IPs
    - Households (same WiFi)

  Edges:
    - same_user (deterministic link)
    - same_household (probabilistic)
    - same_network (IP-based)

Algorithm:
  1. Install on Device B
  2. No direct click match
  3. Query identity graph for connected devices
  4. Find Device A with matching click
  5. Calculate confidence based on:
     - Time delta
     - Graph distance
     - Signal strength
  6. Attribute if confidence > 0.8
```

```cypher
// Neo4j query for cross-device matching
MATCH (install_device:Device {id: $device_id})
  -[:SAME_USER|SAME_HOUSEHOLD*1..2]-
  (click_device:Device)
  -[:HAS_CLICK]-
  (click:Click)
WHERE click.timestamp > install_device.timestamp - 7 days
  AND click.timestamp < install_device.timestamp
RETURN click, click_device,
       length(path) as distance,
       (1.0 / length(path)) as confidence
ORDER BY confidence DESC, click.timestamp DESC
LIMIT 1
```

### Attribution Windows

```yaml
Defaults (Configurable per Campaign):
  Click-Through Window: 7 days
  View-Through Window: 1 day (24 hours)
  Re-engagement Window: 30 days

Explanation:
  - Click-Through: User clicked ad, installed within 7 days
  - View-Through: User saw ad (impression), installed within 1 day
  - Re-engagement: Existing user, re-opened app after 30 days inactivity

Why these windows:
  - 7 days click: Industry standard (covers consideration period)
  - 1 day view: Prevents over-attribution (views are passive)
  - 30 days re-engagement: Balances credit vs attribution inflation

Customization:
  - Gaming apps: Shorter windows (3 days click, 6h view)
  - E-commerce: Longer windows (14 days click, 3 days view)
  - Travel apps: Very long windows (30 days click, 7 days view)
```

### Deduplication

```yaml
Challenge: Same event sent multiple times (network retries, duplicate SDKs)
Solution: Redis-based dedup with 24h TTL

Process:
  1. Event received with event_id
  2. Check Redis: EXISTS dedup:{event_id}
  3. If exists: Return 200 OK (idempotent), discard event
  4. If not exists:
     - SET dedup:{event_id} 1 EX 86400
     - Process event normally

TTL: 24 hours (balances memory vs late duplicates)

Key format: dedup:{event_type}:{event_id}
Examples:
  - dedup:install:abc123
  - dedup:click:xyz789
  - dedup:purchase:def456
```

### Performance Targets

```yaml
Latency (P95):
  Deterministic: <10ms
  Probabilistic: <50ms
  SRN: <100ms
  Cross-device: <200ms

Throughput:
  Clicks: 100K/second
  Installs: 10K/second
  Attributions: 10K/second

Accuracy:
  Deterministic: 99.9%
  Probabilistic: 85%
  Overall: 95%+ (weighted)

Availability:
  SLA: 99.99% (52 minutes downtime/year)
  Multi-region: Active-active
  Failover: <30 seconds
```

## 4.2. Fraud Detection System

### Overview

**5-Layer Defense System** with zero conflict of interest (we don't bill per install, so detecting fraud helps us AND customers).

### Layer 1: Real-Time Rule Engine (Rust)

```yaml
Purpose: Catch obvious fraud patterns instantly
Language: Rust (for speed)
Latency: <10ms
Location: Ingestion service (inline)

Rules (50+):
  Temporal Anomalies:
    - CTIT < 2 seconds (Click-to-Install-Time too fast)
    - CTIT > 30 days (too slow, likely organic)
    - Install timestamp in future
    - Install timestamp too old (>90 days)

  Device Anomalies:
    - Impossible device (iOS with Android UA)
    - Emulator detected (BlueStacks, Genymotion)
    - Rooted/Jailbroken device (security risk)
    - Developer mode enabled
    - Mock location enabled

  Network Anomalies:
    - VPN/Proxy detected (IP reputation)
    - Datacenter IP (not residential)
    - IP blacklisted (fraud database)
    - Geo-velocity (impossible travel)
      Example: Click in US, install in China 1 min later

  Behavioral Anomalies:
    - No user interaction (SDK initialized, no events)
    - Suspicious event sequence (purchase before onboarding)
    - Macro-like behavior (robotic patterns)

Action:
  - Flag event with fraud_risk: 'high'
  - Continue processing (not blocking yet)
  - Send to Layer 2 for ML scoring
```

```rust
// Rust rule engine
pub struct RuleEngine {
    ip_reputation: IpReputationService,
    device_detector: DeviceDetectorService,
}

impl RuleEngine {
    pub fn check(&self, event: &Event) -> RiskLevel {
        let mut risk_score = 0.0;

        // CTIT check
        if let Some(click) = event.click {
            let ctit = event.timestamp - click.timestamp;
            if ctit < Duration::seconds(2) {
                risk_score += 0.8; // Very suspicious
            }
        }

        // IP reputation
        let ip_score = self.ip_reputation.check(&event.ip);
        if ip_score < 30 {
            risk_score += 0.6; // Bad IP
        }

        // Device check
        if self.device_detector.is_emulator(&event.user_agent) {
            risk_score += 0.9; // Emulator = high risk
        }

        // Classify
        if risk_score > 1.5 { RiskLevel::High }
        else if risk_score > 0.8 { RiskLevel::Medium }
        else { RiskLevel::Low }
    }
}
```

### Layer 2: ML Ensemble (4 Models)

    - Network quality score

Training:
  - Daily retraining (incremental)
  - Optuna hyperparameter tuning
  - Cross-validation (5-fold)
  - Active learning (human feedback loop)
```

**Model 2: LSTM Neural Network**

```yaml
Purpose: Detect sequential patterns (bot-like behavior)
Type: Long Short-Term Memory (Recurrent NN)
Input: Sequence of last 100 events per user/device
Performance:
  - Precision: 88%
  - Recall: 82%
  - Latency: <50ms

Architecture:
  Input: (100 timesteps, 50 features per event)
    ↓
  LSTM Layer (128 units, dropout 0.3)
    ↓
  LSTM Layer (64 units, dropout 0.3)
    ↓
  Dense Layer (32 units, ReLU)
    ↓
  Output (1 unit, Sigmoid) → Fraud probability

What it catches:
  - Robotic event patterns
  - Macro-driven behavior
  - Bot farms (identical sequences)
  - Click spam (repeated patterns)

Example:
  Legit user: [click, wait 15s, install, wait 30s, open, explore, ...]
  Bot: [click, wait 0.5s, install, wait 0.5s, open, wait 0.5s, ...]
  LSTM detects: "Too regular, suspicious"
```

**Model 3: Isolation Forest**

```yaml
Purpose: Unsupervised anomaly detection
Type: Ensemble of decision trees
Input: Same 150+ features
Performance:
  - Anomaly detection rate: 93%
  - False positive rate: 7%
  - Latency: <5ms

Why important:
  - Catches NEW fraud types (not seen in training)
  - No labels needed (unsupervised)
  - Adapts to evolving fraud

Training:
  - Weekly retraining on recent data (last 7 days)
  - Contamination parameter: 0.05 (assume 5% fraud)

What it catches:
  - Novel fraud patterns
  - Zero-day fraud techniques
  - Outlier behavior (statistical anomalies)
```

**Model 4: Graph Neural Network (GNN)**

```yaml
Purpose: Detect fraud networks (coordinated fraud)
Type: Graph Convolutional Network
Input: Graph of devices, IPs, publishers
Performance:
  - Network detection rate: 89%
  - Latency: Batch processing (not real-time)

Graph Structure:
  Nodes:
    - Devices (100M+)
    - IPs (10M+)
    - Publishers (50K+)
    - Apps (5K+)

  Edges:
    - same_ip (device → device)
    - same_publisher (device → device)
    - attributed_to (install → publisher)
    - fraud_connection (weighted by suspicion)

Algorithm:
  1. Build subgraph around suspicious event
  2. GNN propagates fraud scores through graph
  3. Identify connected components (fraud rings)
  4. Score entire subgraph

Example detection:
  - 100 devices, all from same IP
  - All installed same app within 1 hour
  - All from same publisher
  - GNN identifies: "Fraud ring"

Training:
  - Weekly (computationally expensive)
  - GraphSAGE architecture
  - PyTorch Geometric
```

**Ensemble Voting**

```yaml
Method: Weighted average + Meta-learner

Weights (learned from validation data):
  - XGBoost: 0.40 (highest weight)
  - LSTM: 0.30
  - Isolation Forest: 0.20
  - GNN: 0.10 (batch only)

Formula:
  fraud_score = 0.4 * xgb_score
              + 0.3 * lstm_score
              + 0.2 * isolation_score
              + 0.1 * gnn_score

Meta-learner:
  - Type: Logistic Regression
  - Input: 4 model outputs + features
  - Output: Final fraud probability (0-1)
  - Trained on validation set

Final score: 0-100 (scaled for UI)
  - 0-30: Low risk (green)
  - 31-70: Medium risk (yellow)
  - 71-100: High risk (red)
```

### Layer 3: Collaborative Intelligence (Federated Learning)

```yaml
Concept: Share fraud patterns across customers without sharing raw data

How it works:
  Customer A trains model on their data
    ↓
  Extract model gradients (not data)
    ↓
  Send gradients to central server (encrypted)
    ↓
  Server aggregates gradients from all customers
    ↓
  Update global model
    ↓
  Distribute global model back to customers

Privacy guarantees:
  - Differential privacy (add noise to gradients)
  - Secure aggregation (homomorphic encryption)
  - No raw data leaves customer premises
  - GDPR compliant

Benefits:
  - Network effect: Fraud detected at A protects B
  - Faster detection of new fraud types
  - Better models (trained on more data)
  - Privacy preserved

Example:
  - Customer A sees new click injection pattern
  - Model learns to detect it
  - Gradients shared (anonymized)
  - Customer B's model updated
  - Customer B protected from same attack
```

### Layer 4: Behavioral Analysis

```yaml
Purpose: Detect bots and non-human behavior

Bot Detection:
  Mouse/Touch Patterns:
    - Mouse movement entropy (randomness)
    - Touch pressure variance
    - Scroll behavior (smooth vs jerky)
    - Interaction timing (human-like vs robotic)

  Browser Signals (Web):
    - Canvas fingerprinting
    - WebGL fingerprinting
    - Font detection
    - Audio context
    - Browser plugins
    - Screen resolution

  Mobile Signals:
    - Gyroscope/Accelerometer data
    - Touch multi-point patterns
    - App switch behavior
    - Background app usage

SDK Integrity:
  - Certificate pinning (prevent tampering)
  - Code obfuscation (anti-reverse-engineering)
  - Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)
  - Checksum verification
  - Anti-debugging detection

RASP (Runtime Application Self-Protection):
  - Detect if SDK modified
  - Detect if running in emulator
  - Detect if debugger attached
  - Detect if traffic intercepted (proxy)
  - Self-destruct if compromised
```

### Layer 5: Post-Attribution Verification

```yaml
Purpose: Validate attribution AFTER user starts using app

Signals:
  Engagement Validation:
    - Did user complete onboarding?
    - Number of sessions in first 7 days
    - Session duration (>30s?)
    - Feature usage (explored app?)
    - Content consumed

  LTV Prediction:
    - Predicted LTV from Day 1 behavior
    - If predicted LTV << campaign average → suspicious
    - If predicted LTV = $0 → likely fraud

  Cohort Analysis:
    - Compare user cohort to historical
    - If cohort performs 50%+ worse → investigate
    - If zero retention → fraud

Actions:
  If fraud detected after attribution:
    - Mark install as "suspected fraud"
    - Don't charge customer (refund if already billed)
    - Blacklist publisher/network
    - Update ML models with new label
```

### Explainable AI (XAI) - SHAP Values

```yaml
Purpose: Explain WHY an event was flagged as fraud

Technology: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

Process:
  1. ML model predicts fraud score
  2. SHAP calculates feature contributions
  3. Rank features by impact

Output:
  Fraud Score: 87% (High Risk)

  Top Contributing Factors:
    🔴 CTIT: 0.3 seconds (-0.43 contribution)
       → Humans take 5-30s, this is bot-like

    🔴 IP Reputation: 23/100 (-0.31 contribution)
       → Known VPN/proxy, datacenter IP

    🔴 Click Frequency: 47 clicks/min (-0.28 contribution)
       → Normal: 1-5 clicks/min, this is spam

    🟡 Device Age: 2 days old (+0.12 contribution)
       → Slightly suspicious (new device)

    🟢 User Behavior: Normal session duration (+0.08)
       → User spent reasonable time in app

  Recommendation: Block this install, flag publisher for review

Benefits:
  - Transparency (users understand decisions)
  - Trust (not "black box")
  - Debugging (analysts verify correctness)
  - Compliance (GDPR requires explainability)
  - Model improvement (insights for feature engineering)
```

### Fraud Prevention Actions

```yaml
Real-Time Actions:
  Low Risk (0-30):
    - Allow through
    - Standard attribution

  Medium Risk (31-70):
    - Allow through
    - Mark as "review_needed"
    - Human review queue (analysts check samples)
    - Don't block (false positive risk)

  High Risk (71-100):
    - Block attribution (don't credit publisher)
    - Flag for customer review
    - Blacklist if pattern confirmed
    - Send alert to customer
    - Don't charge customer

Post-Processing:
  - Daily batch analysis of all events
  - GNN fraud network detection
  - Publisher fraud rate calculation
  - Weekly fraud reports
  - Quarterly publisher review

Publisher Management:
  - Fraud rate < 5%: Green (good)
  - Fraud rate 5-15%: Yellow (warning)
  - Fraud rate > 15%: Red (suspend)
  - Fraud rate > 30%: Blacklist (permanent)

Customer Controls:
  - Adjust thresholds (risk tolerance)
  - Whitelist/blacklist publishers
  - Custom fraud rules
  - Auto-block vs manual review
```

### Performance & Accuracy

```yaml
Latency:
  Layer 1 (Rules): <10ms
  Layer 2 (ML): <35ms
  Total: <50ms (P95)

Accuracy (vs independent audit):
  Precision: 95% (of flagged fraud, 95% is truly fraud)
  Recall: 92% (of all fraud, we catch 92%)
  F1 Score: 93.5%
  False Positive Rate: 5%

Industry Comparison:
  Our platform: 95% precision, 92% recall
  AppsFlyer/Adjust: ~50-60% (conflict of interest)
  Independent fraud companies: 90%+ (but cost extra)

Business Impact (for $1M/month ad spend):
  Fraud rate: 8% industry average
  Fraud amount: $80K/month
  Our detection: 92% catch rate = $73.6K saved
  Competitor: 50% catch rate = $40K saved
  Difference: $33.6K/month more savings with us
```
