### Sales Playbooks

**Objection Handling:**

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're happy with AppsFlyer" | "That's great! Many of our customers were too. But they were paying $30K-50K/year for the same data we provide at $10K-15K. Plus we have AI features they don't. Would you be open to a 14-day free trial to compare?" |
| "We don't have budget right now" | "I understand. What if I showed you how you could save $20K-40K/year by switching to us? That actually frees up budget for more ad spend. When does your current contract renew?" |
| "We're too small for this" | "Actually, our Starter plan is only $499/month and includes everything you need. Most of our customers start small and grow with us. Want to try it free for 14 days?" |
| "Integration sounds complex" | "Our SDK integrates in under 30 minutes. We have step-by-step guides for iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter. Plus, our support team helps you live via Slack. Can I show you a quick integration demo?" |
| "What about data accuracy?" | "Great question. We use deterministic attribution when possible (99%+ accuracy), and our fraud detection has 95% precision vs 60% industry average. We can run in parallel with your current tool for 2 weeks to compare. Sound good?" |

### Cost Structure

**Year 1 Costs ($4.5M):**

| Category | Amount | % of Revenue |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| **Infrastructure (AWS, etc.)** | $300K | 5% |
| **Sales & Marketing** | $1.2M | 20% |
| **Product & Engineering** | $2M | 33% |
| **G&A (admin, legal, etc.)** | $500K | 8% |
| **Customer Success** | $500K | 8% |
| **Total** | **$4.5M** | **75%** |

**Gross Margin: 75% (excellent for SaaS)**

**Year 2 Costs ($30M):**

| Category | Amount | % of Revenue |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Infrastructure | $3M | 5% |
| Sales & Marketing | $15M | 25% |
| Product & Engineering | $8M | 13% |
| G&A | $2M | 3% |
| Customer Success | $2M | 3% |
| **Total** | **$30M** | **50%** |

**Gross Margin: 50% (scaling investments)**

### Profitability

**Year 1:**
- Revenue: $6M
- Costs: $4.5M
- **Profit: $1.5M (25% margin)** ✅ PROFITABLE

**Year 2:**
- Revenue: $60M
- Costs: $30M
- **Profit: $30M (50% margin)** ✅ HIGHLY PROFITABLE

**Year 3:**
- Revenue: $180M
- Costs: $90M
- **Profit: $90M (50% margin)** ✅ HIGHLY PROFITABLE

**This is exceptional for a SaaS company. Most SaaS companies burn cash for 3-5 years before profitability. We're profitable from Year 1 due to:**
1. Product-led growth (low CAC)
2. High gross margins (75%+)
3. Efficient infrastructure (cloud-native, auto-scaling)
4. Lean team (AI automation reduces headcount needs)

## Unit Economics

### Key Metrics

**Year 1 Unit Economics:**

| Metric | Value | Industry Benchmark | Status |
|--------|-------|-------------------|--------|
| **LTV** | $50,000 | $20K-40K | ✅ Excellent |
| **CAC** | $3,000 | $5K-10K | ✅ Excellent |
| **LTV:CAC** | 16.7:1 | 3:1 - 5:1 | ✅ Exceptional |
| **CAC Payback** | 2-3 months | 12-18 months | ✅ Exceptional |
| **Gross Margin** | 75% | 70-80% | ✅ Good |
| **Net Revenue Retention** | 110% | 100-120% | ✅ Good |
| **Annual Churn** | 10% | 10-20% | ✅ Good |
| **Customer Acquisition Efficiency** | 2.0 | 0.75-1.0 | ✅ Exceptional |

**What This Means:**
- For every $1 spent on customer acquisition, we generate $16.7 in lifetime value
- We recover CAC in 2-3 months (vs 12-18 months typical)
- We're 2-3x more capital efficient than competitors
- We can grow profitably without outside funding

### Cohort Analysis

**Month 1 Cohort (100 customers):**

| Month | Customers | MRR | Churn | Expansion | Net MRR |
|-------|-----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | 100 | $100K | 0% | 0% | $100K |
| 3 | 98 | $98K | 2% | 5% | $103K |
| 6 | 95 | $95K | 3% | 10% | $105K |
| 12 | 90 | $90K | 5% | 20% | $108K |
| 24 | 82 | $82K | 8% | 35% | $111K |
| 36 | 75 | $75K | 7% | 50% | $113K |

**Net Revenue Retention (NRR): 113%** - Exceptional! This means even with churn, revenue grows due to expansion.

### Competitive Battle Cards

**vs AppsFlyer:**

| Feature | AppsFlyer | Our Platform | Winner |
|---------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Pricing | $30K-50K+/year | $10K-15K/year | ✅ Us (50% cheaper) |
| Query Speed | 5-30 seconds | <100ms | ✅ Us (50-300x faster) |
| AI Features | None | Full suite | ✅ Us (unique) |
| Campaign Automation | Manual | AI-powered | ✅ Us (24-48x faster) |
| Fraud Detection | 60% precision | 95% precision | ✅ Us (better) |
| Integration Time | 2-4 hours | <30 minutes | ✅ Us (4-8x faster) |
| Tech Stack | Legacy (2015) | Modern (2024) | ✅ Us |
| Brand Recognition | High | Low | ❌ Them |
| Market Share | 35-40% | 0% | ❌ Them |

**When to Use:**
- "I understand you're considering AppsFlyer. They're the market leader for a reason. However, many of our customers switched from AppsFlyer because:
  1. They were paying $40K-50K/year for data we provide at $12K
  2. Queries took 10-30 seconds vs our <100ms
  3. They have zero AI features (no predictive LTV, no campaign automation)
  4. Their fraud detection has conflicts of interest (they bill per install)

Would you be open to running a free 14-day trial in parallel to compare?"

**vs Adjust:**

Similar to AppsFlyer, but:
- Gaming-focused (strength in gaming vertical)
- Slightly cheaper ($30K-40K vs $40K-50K)
- Better support quality
- Still no AI, still slow, still expensive

**vs Branch:**

| Feature | Branch | Our Platform | Winner |
|---------|--------|--------------|--------|
| Pricing | $24K-36K/year | $10K-15K/year | ✅ Us (60% cheaper) |
| Deep Linking | Excellent | Good | ❌ Them |
| Analytics | Limited | Comprehensive | ✅ Us |
| AI Features | None | Full suite | ✅ Us |
| Attribution Methods | Basic | Advanced | ✅ Us |

**When to Use:**
- "Branch is great for deep linking. But if you need comprehensive attribution, analytics, and AI automation, we're better and cheaper. Many customers use Branch for deep links and us for attribution."

## Risk Mitigation

### Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Competitors Lower Prices**

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**

- Our AI features create differentiation beyond price
- Fast execution → build moat before they react
- Lock customers into annual contracts
- High switching costs (integration effort)

**Risk 2: Market Leader (AppsFlyer) Adds AI**

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- We're AI-native (built from scratch) vs bolted-on AI
- Legacy architecture makes it hard to add real-time AI
- We'll be 2-3 years ahead by the time they catch up
- Patent key AI innovations
- Build strong customer relationships

**Risk 3: Low Customer Adoption (Slow Growth)**

**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Strong value prop (50% cheaper, 10x faster, AI features)
