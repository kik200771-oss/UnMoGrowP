```

### ✅ Release Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml (270 lines)

# ... optimized ML service build

FROM scratch AS final
# Minimal production images
```

### 2. Build Cache Strategy
```yaml
# Enhanced cache configuration
- name: Cache Dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.npm

      ~/.cache/pip
      node_modules
      vendor
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-deps-${{ hashFiles('**/*.lock') }}
```

### 3. Parallel Execution Matrix
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    component: [frontend, api-gateway, backend, ml-services]
    environment: [development, staging, production]
  max-parallel: 4
