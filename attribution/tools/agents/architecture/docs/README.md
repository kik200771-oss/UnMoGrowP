## API Reference

### Core Methods

#### `analyzeSystemDesign(requirements: string)`

```typescript
const solution = await architectureAgent.analyzeSystemDesign(`
  Design real-time attribution system:
  - 10M events/second processing
  - < 1 second attribution latency
  - Multi-tenant support
  - 5 attribution models
`);

console.log(solution.components); // Component designs
console.log(solution.dataFlow);   // Data flow analysis
console.log(solution.patterns);   // Design patterns
```

**Returns**: `ArchitecturalSolution`
- Component designs with responsibilities
- Data flow specifications
- Applied design patterns
- Performance considerations

#### `reviewCodeArchitecture(codebase: string)`
Reviews existing codebase architecture and provides improvement recommendations.

```typescript
const review = await architectureAgent.reviewCodeArchitecture(codebase);

console.log(`Architecture Score: ${review.score}/100`);
console.log('Critical Issues:', review.issues.filter(i => i.severity === 'critical'));
console.log('Recommendations:', review.recommendations);
```

**Returns**: `ArchitectureReview`
- Architecture quality score (0-100)
- Categorized issues with severity levels
- Prioritized recommendations
- Compliance assessment
- Technical debt analysis

#### `designEventFlow(events: string[])`
Designs event-driven architecture for attribution event processing.

```typescript
const eventFlow = await architectureAgent.designEventFlow([
  'install', 'open', 'purchase', 'register', 'share'
]);

console.log(eventFlow.flow);       // Event flow design
console.log(eventFlow.processors); // Processing components
console.log(eventFlow.monitoring); // Monitoring strategy
```

**Returns**: Event processing architecture
- Event flow specifications
- Processing component designs
- Queue configurations
- Storage strategies
- Monitoring recommendations

#### `manageTechnicalDebt(codebase?: string)`
Assesses technical debt and creates remediation plan.

```typescript
const debtPlan = await architectureAgent.manageTechnicalDebt(codebase);

console.log(`Debt Level: ${debtPlan.level}`);
console.log('Priority Items:', debtPlan.items);
console.log('Remediation Plan:', debtPlan.prioritizedPlan);
```

**Returns**: `TechDebtAssessment`
- Overall debt level assessment
- Specific debt items with impact/effort
- Prioritized remediation plan
- Timeline estimates

#### `validatePerformance(requirements: PerformanceRequirements)`
Validates architecture against performance targets.

```typescript
const validation = await architectureAgent.validatePerformance({
  targetThroughput: '10M events/sec',
  targetLatency: '< 100ms P95',
  expectedUsers: 100000,
  dataVolume: '1TB/day'
});

console.log(validation.bottlenecks);    // Performance bottlenecks
console.log(validation.optimizations);  // Optimization recommendations
```

**Returns**: Performance validation analysis
- Bottleneck identification
- Optimization recommendations
- Scaling strategies
- Monitoring requirements

## Usage Examples

### 1. System Design for New Feature

```typescript
import { ArchitectureAgent } from '@/tools/agents/architecture/agent';

const agent = new ArchitectureAgent(process.env.CLAUDE_API_KEY);

// Design fraud detection feature
const fraudArchitecture = await agent.analyzeSystemDesign(`
  Design real-time fraud detection system:
  - Process attribution events for fraud signals
  - ML-based anomaly detection
  - Integration with existing event pipeline
  - Sub-second detection latency
  - False positive rate < 0.1%
`);

console.log('Fraud Detection Architecture:', fraudArchitecture);
```

### 2. Architecture Review for Performance

```typescript
// Review current event processing architecture
const codebase = await fs.readFile('services/ingestion/main.go', 'utf8');
const review = await agent.reviewCodeArchitecture(codebase);

// Focus on performance issues
const performanceIssues = review.issues.filter(
  issue => issue.category === 'performance'
);

console.log('Performance Issues:', performanceIssues);
```

### 3. Technical Debt Management

```typescript
// Assess technical debt across codebase
const debtAssessment = await agent.manageTechnicalDebt();

// Create sprint planning based on debt priorities
const sprintTasks = debtAssessment.items
  .filter(item => item.priority <= 3)
  .map(item => ({
    task: item.description,
    effort: item.effort,
    impact: item.impact
  }));

console.log('Sprint Tasks:', sprintTasks);
```

### 4. Event Architecture Design

```typescript
// Design attribution event processing
const eventArchitecture = await agent.designEventFlow([
  'app_install',
  'app_open',
  'purchase',
  'registration',
  'share_content',
  'ad_click',
  'ad_impression'
]);

console.log('Event Processors:', eventArchitecture.processors);
console.log('Data Flow:', eventArchitecture.flow);
```
