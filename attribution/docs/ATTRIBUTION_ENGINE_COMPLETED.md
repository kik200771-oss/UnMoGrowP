## 📈 Technical Specifications

### Attribution Models Implemented ✅
1. **First Touch Attribution**: 100% credit to first touchpoint
2. **Last Touch Attribution**: 100% credit to last touchpoint
3. **Linear Attribution**: Equal credit across all touchpoints
4. **Time Decay Attribution**: Exponential decay favoring recent interactions
5. **Position-Based Attribution**: 40% first + 40% last + 20% middle touchpoints

### Performance Characteristics ⚡
- **Event Queue Capacity**: 20,000 events
- **Processing Rate**: 20 operations/second (50ms intervals)
- **Attribution Calculation**: Multi-model simultaneous processing
- **Data Storage**: ClickHouse optimized for analytics
- **Memory Management**: Automatic batch processing with timeouts
