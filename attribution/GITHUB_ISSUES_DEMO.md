# üìã GitHub Issues Demonstration - UnMoGrowP Attribution Platform

This document contains demonstration issues that showcase the proper engineering process for the UnMoGrowP Attribution Platform. These issues can be created on GitHub to establish a proper development workflow.

## üéØ Why This Matters

Proper issue management enables:
- **Code Review**: Every change goes through PR review process
- **Decision History**: Track why decisions were made
- **Feature Planning**: Organized development roadmap
- **Bug Tracking**: Systematic problem resolution
- **Release Management**: Structured version control

## üìù Issue Templates Examples

### Issue #1: Feature Request - Real-time Attribution Dashboard

**Title**: `[FEATURE] Real-time Attribution Dashboard for Customer Success Metrics`

**Labels**: `enhancement`, `web-ui`, `high-priority`, `customer-success`

**Component**: web-ui

**Description**:
Currently, customer success metrics are only visible in database queries. We need a real-time dashboard that displays:

- Customer satisfaction scores
- Attribution accuracy metrics
- API latency performance
- System uptime status
- Cost savings achievements

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Dashboard displays all 5 key metrics in real-time
- [ ] Updates every 30 seconds via WebSocket connection
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Export functionality (PDF/CSV)
- [ ] Performance target: <2 second initial load

**Technical Requirements**:
- Use Svelte 5 with existing component architecture
- Connect to customer_metrics table in PostgreSQL
- Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
- Add data visualization with Chart.js or D3

**Priority**: High - Critical for customer demos

### Issue #2: Bug Report - ClickHouse Query Performance

**Title**: `[BUG] ClickHouse attribution queries timeout after 10 seconds`

**Labels**: `bug`, `performance`, `clickhouse`, `critical`

**Component**: attribution service

**Bug Description**:
Attribution queries are timing out when processing large datasets (>100K events). This affects customer pilots with high event volumes.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Send 100K+ events to ingestion service
2. Query attribution data via API `/api/attribution/report`
3. Request times out after 10 seconds
4. See 504 Gateway Timeout error

**Expected Behavior**:
Attribution queries should complete within 2-3 seconds for datasets up to 1M events.

**Environment**:
- ClickHouse: 23.8
- Go service: 1.21
- Event volume: 150K events/hour
- Query: Attribution report for last 30 days

**Performance Metrics**:
- Current: 12+ second query time
- Target: <3 second query time
- Peak events: 150K/hour
- Data size: 2.1GB attribution data

**Additional Context**:
This is blocking pilot customer "TechCorp Solutions" from going live. They need real-time attribution for their mobile app campaigns.

### Issue #3: Performance Issue - API Gateway Bottleneck

**Title**: `[PERF] API Gateway response times exceed 5 seconds under load`

**Labels**: `performance`, `api-gateway`, `triage`

**Component**: api-gateway

**Performance Issue**:
API Gateway is experiencing high latency during peak traffic periods, affecting customer experience.

**Performance Metrics**:
- Average response time: 8.2 seconds
- Peak memory usage: 2.1 GB
- Concurrent requests: 500+
- Database connection pool: 95% utilization

**Load Conditions**:
- Event volume: 50K events/minute
- Concurrent users: 200+
- Dashboard queries: 100/minute
- Attribution requests: 50/minute

**Expected Performance**:
- API responses: <1 second
- Support: 100K events/minute
- Memory usage: <1GB
- 99.9% uptime target

### Issue #4: Feature Request - Multi-Tenant Security Enhancement

**Title**: `[FEATURE] Enhanced Multi-Tenant Data Isolation with Advanced RBAC`

**Labels**: `enhancement`, `security`, `rbac`, `medium-priority`

**Component**: api-gateway, database

**Feature Description**:
Enhance the existing RBAC system with advanced multi-tenant security features for enterprise customers.

**Current State**:
- Basic RBAC with 5 role types
- Row Level Security (RLS) in PostgreSQL
- Organization-based data partitioning

**Proposed Enhancement**:
- Custom role creation per organization
- Granular permission matrix (read/write/admin per feature)
- Audit trail for all data access
- Cross-tenant analytics (admin only)
- SSO integration (SAML/OAuth)

**Business Impact**:
- Enables enterprise customers with complex organizational structures
- Improves security compliance (SOC 2, GDPR)
- Increases customer satisfaction scores

**Priority**: Medium - Required for Q1 enterprise deals

- Single-server deployment
- Manual scaling
- Limited monitoring

**Target State**:
- Kubernetes cluster for production
- Auto-scaling capabilities
- Rolling deployments
- Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana

**Components to Migrate**:
